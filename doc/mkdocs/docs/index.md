# Docma User Guide

#### Version 0.0.0

**Docma** is a PDF document generator that can assemble and compose PDF and HTML documents
from document templates with dynamic content.

**Docma** was developed at [Origin Energy](https://www.originenergy.com.au) as part of the
*Jindabyne* initiative. While not part of our core IP, it proved valuable
internally, and we're sharing it in the hope it's useful to others.

Kudos to Origin for fostering a culture that empowers its people
to build complex technology solutions in-house.
